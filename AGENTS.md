## Project
PMP Trainer is a single-page, static PMP practice tool published with GitHub Pages.

- Main application: `index.html`
- No build system or framework is currently required.
- UI copy is primarily Traditional Chinese (Taiwan usage).
- `main` is the production / deploy branch.
- `dev` is the integration branch.
- Cross-project workflow follows the canonical AI Product Development Playbook v1.0 in `Naiyi-Chia/naiyi-product-playbook`.

## Source of Truth
The GitHub Issue is the Source of Truth for each development task.

Before implementation, read the Issue and treat its Goal, Scope, Expected Behavior, Constraints, and Acceptance Criteria as the task contract.

If Scope, Expected Behavior, or Acceptance Criteria changes during implementation:
1. Stop expanding the implementation.
2. Update the GitHub Issue first.
3. Continue only after the Issue reflects the new requirement.

Do not keep requirement changes only in chat, commit messages, PR comments, or handoff text.

## Before making changes
1. Confirm the repository root.
2. Fetch origin.
3. Switch to `dev` and update from `origin/dev`.
4. Confirm the working tree is clean.
5. Read the relevant GitHub Issue.
6. Read this `AGENTS.md`.
7. Create a scoped branch from the latest `dev`, for example:
   - `feat/issue-N-short-name`
   - `fix/issue-N-short-name`
   - `ux/issue-N-short-name`
   - `maint/issue-N-short-name`
8. Inspect the existing implementation before editing; do not duplicate existing behavior.

## Editing rules
- Keep changes scoped to the Issue. Avoid unrelated refactors.
- Prefer small, reviewable diffs.
- Keep the current vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript approach unless the Issue explicitly requires an architecture change.
- Preserve mobile usability and basic accessibility.
- Do not modify the embedded PMP question bank, answer keys, explanations, or PMI sample content unless the Issue specifically concerns question content.
- Do not remove or change existing user progress / localStorage behavior unless explicitly requested.
- Do not add external dependencies unless the need is documented in the Issue.
- Do not change unrelated files merely to reformat them.

## Validation
There is not yet a full automated test suite. Before reporting implementation ready for review, run the relevant checks and record the result.

Minimum smoke checks after UI / JavaScript changes:
- Page loads without obvious JavaScript errors.
- Practice mode can start and navigate questions.
- Existing tabs still open normally.
- The changed feature works on a desktop-sized viewport.
- The changed feature remains usable on a mobile-sized viewport (target around 375px where relevant).
- No unintended horizontal scroll is introduced.
- Run `git diff --check` before commit.

For feedback-form changes also verify:
- Overall feedback opens the intended Google Form.
- Question feedback opens the form with the expected question metadata when applicable.
- Expected category preselection / non-preselection is correct.
- Feedback opens in a new tab when required.
- Returning to the trainer does not break the current practice session.

## Implementation completion
When implementation is complete:
1. Review the final diff.
2. Run relevant QA / smoke checks.
3. Run `git diff --check`.
4. Commit the scoped change.
5. Push the feature branch.

By default, stop after push and report back. Do not open a PR unless the human explicitly authorizes it.

## Completion report
Report:
- Issue number.
- Branch name.
- Commit SHA.
- Files changed.
- Approximate `+/-` lines when available.
- What changed.
- Tests / browser QA performed and results.
- Known limitations or follow-up work.
- Final `git status` / working-tree state.

## Human gates
Unless explicitly authorized by the human, an Engineering Agent must not independently:
- open a Pull Request;
- merge into `dev`;
- merge into `main`;
- close the Issue;
- declare Human Verify complete;
- make a release decision;
- claim the production site is verified.

Human Verify and release approval are separate gates from agent testing.

## Branch and release model
Default lifecycle:

```text
Issue
→ scoped branch from latest dev
→ implementation + local/browser QA
→ commit + push
→ ChatGPT diff / scope review
→ Feature PR: feature → dev
→ Human Verify
→ merge to dev
→ Ready for Release (Issue remains open)
→ Release PR: dev → main
→ Human release approval
→ merge to main
→ Production Smoke
→ Done / Close Issue
```

Feature PRs may use squash merge. Release PRs should normally use a normal merge so `dev` ancestry is preserved.

After a release, sync `dev` to the latest `main` with a fast-forward when safe. If it cannot fast-forward, inspect branch history first; never force blindly.
